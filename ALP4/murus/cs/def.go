/* Universal Synchronizations for the construction of protocols to enter
   general conditioned kritical sections with use of commen ressources,
   whose state could be changed, of processes of at most two classes.
   General conditioned critical sections can be entered concurrently
   by several processes of one class, but by processes of different classes
   only under mutual exclusion.
   The classes are identified by natural numbers, starting with 0.
   Mutual exclusion of processes of different classes is guaranteed by clients
   in form of boolean expressions, under which a critical section may be entered;
   in the enter and leave protocol operations are executed,
   that control the conditions.
   The functions Enter and Leave cannot be interrupted by calls of these functions
   of other processes. */
